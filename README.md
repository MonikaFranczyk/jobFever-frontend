🗝️The main key features are: 
- authentication for candidate and employer by JWT Token, 
- Inserting and downloading CV
- employer's evaluation of a candidate with stars, 
- CV applying, no hidden salary bracket for candidates.

In opposite to similar platforms where we need to pay for posting job offers,
